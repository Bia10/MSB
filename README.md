A MapleStory trainer.

- This trainer worked for the Global MapleStory region, versions 128 to 140.
- This trainer contained the first public generic no delay and unlimited mana hack!
- I had decided to open source the project due to personal beliefs of sharing with the community, only for now to push it to my github.

Enjoy.
